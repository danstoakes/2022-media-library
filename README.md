# Laravel Media Library

Built upon Spatie Media Library.

Future plans
* Have different albums, i.e. via the collection names. When uploading a new image, it should have a dropdown of all available collections or allow option for a new one.
* read_exif_data to get exif data as a json string to be written to the database and retrieved/parsed into a EXIF model.
